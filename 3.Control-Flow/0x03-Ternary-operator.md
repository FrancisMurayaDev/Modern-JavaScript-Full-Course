# Ternary Operator

Ternary operator provides a concise way of writing an if else statement in a single line of code.

The syntax is:

```js
condition ? expression if condition is true : expression if condition is false
```

Example in Code:

```js
const age = 25;

age > 18 ? console.log("You are an adult") : console.log("You are a child");
```
