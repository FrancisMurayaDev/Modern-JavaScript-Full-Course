# Document Object Model

Document Object Model is the standard for how to get, change, modify, add and delete HTML elements.

When a webpage is loaded, the web browser creates DOM of the page which is constructed as a tree of objects.

With DOM, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to work with HTML elements.

- Changing HTML elements.
- Changing attributes of HTML elements.
- Changing the CSS of HTML elements.
- Removing existing HTML elements.
- Creating new HTML elements.
- React to events on a page.

DOM is not part of JavaScript Language, it is part of WEB APIs.

WEB APIs- libraries that the browser impliment and is accessed in JavaScript code.
