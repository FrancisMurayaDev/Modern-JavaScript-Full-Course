# Data Transformation, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.

This are methods to create new arrays by transforming data from other arrays.

## map

Used to loop over arrays and similar to forEach method, the diffrence is that `map` creates a new array based on the original array.

- `forEach` allows us to do some work with each array element.

## filter

Used to filter for elements in the original array, which satisfy a specified condition.

- Only the elements that pass the test will be passed into a new array.
- In otherwords, elements for which the condition will be true, will be included in the new array that the filter method returns.

## reduce

Used to reduce all array elements down to one single value.

`ex:` Adding all elements together.
