# Install Node.JS and setting up a dev environment

## 1. Install LiveServer/ 5 server extension.

It ensures our html page updates automatically whenever we write code.

Write click on the `html file` then select `open with live server`.

### There is an alternative way using Node.js

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">INSTALL NODE.JS</a>

- Start by installing node.js.

Node.js is a way of running JavaScript outside of the browser.

- It is also a way of learning the development tools just like the live-server.

On the terminal, write `node -v`.

- It should return a version of the node installed.

Example:

```js
v22.13.0
```

Since we will be using using `VITE` to spin our project,

We will be running:

```js
npm run dev
```
