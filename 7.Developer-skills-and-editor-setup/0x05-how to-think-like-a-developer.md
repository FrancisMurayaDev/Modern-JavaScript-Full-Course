# How to think like a developer/ Solving Problems

## 4 Steps to solve any problem.

### 1. Make sure you 100% understand the problem.

- Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.

Example: The project manager, "We need a function that reverses whaterver we pass into it."

Some of the questions you could ask yourself:

- What does whaterver mean in this context.
- What type should be reversed?
- What should I do if something else is passed in?
- What type should be returned.
- How to recognize an argument type.
- How to reverse a number, string or an array?

## 2. Divide and Conquer Strategy

To break the big problems into many small problems as possible.

The smaller problems are alittle easier to solve.

Sub-problems:

- check if the argument is a number, string, or an array.
- Impliment reversing a number, string, array.
- return reversed value.

Lets say we dont know how to impliment one of this sub problems.

## 3. Dont be afraid of doing as much research as you have to.

- You can use google, stackoverflow or MDN docs.

`eg:` How to reverse a number in JavaScript.

## 4. For bigger problems, write the pseudo-code before writing the actual code.

Programming is just logic at the end.
