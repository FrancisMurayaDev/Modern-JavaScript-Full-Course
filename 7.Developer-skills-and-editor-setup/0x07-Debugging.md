# Debugging (Fixing Errors)

It means to find and fix errors.

Bug - unexpected or unintended behaviour of a software program.

Bugs are normal in software development.

#### Some bugs are small and easy to discover.

### The Debugging Process.

1. Be aware there is some kind of a bug.

It is important to identify bugs early during development.

Bugs identified during production are the worst, since it means they went undetected during development and testing and now they are affecting the users of the application.

- We need to take the context in which the bug happened.

2. Go into our code and find the bug.

We need to isolate exactly where it is happening.

- We can use the `developer` console for small bugs.
- For complex code, we use a `Debugger`.

3. Fix

Once we find where the bug is, we can fix it.

Replacing the wrong solution with the correct one.

4. Prevent the Bug from Happening again.

Search for a similar bug in the code.

Writing tests using testing software. (advanced way)
