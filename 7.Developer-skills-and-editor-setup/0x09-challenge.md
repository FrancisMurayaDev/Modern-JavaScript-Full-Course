Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermomenter displays a stringwith these temperatures.

`Example:` [17, 21, 23] will print `"... 17°C in 1 days ... 21°C in 2 days ... 23°C in 3 days ..."`

Create a function, `printForecast` which takes in an `arr` and logs a string to the console.

Use the problem solving framework. Understand the problem and break it into the sub-problems.

Test Data 1: [17, 21, 23];
Test Data 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4];
