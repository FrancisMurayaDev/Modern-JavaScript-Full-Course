# Numeric Separators

Used to format numbers in a way thay is easier for us or other developers to read and understand. They are simply underscores that we can place anywhere that we want in our numbers.

Looking at this number here, it can be difficult and hard to read and understand:

```js
const diameter = 278960000000000;
```

We use `underscore separators`

```js
const diameter = 278_960_000_000_000;
```
