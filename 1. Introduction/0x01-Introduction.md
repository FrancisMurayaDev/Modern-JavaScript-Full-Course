# Introduction

JavaScript is the programming language for the web.

It allows us to add interactivity and dynamic functionalities to our websites.

It is a core programming language alongside HTML and CSS.

JS allows us to add website behaviours such as form validation, animations and real-time updates.

## JavaScript Characteristics

1. JavaScript is executed in both client side and server side.

Originally designed for web browsers, JavaScript executes directly in the browser (client-side). However, with environments like Node.js, it can also run on servers (server-side).

2. Interpreted language.

JavaScript is not compiled like languages such as C++ or Java. Instead, the browser or runtime environment reads and executes the code directly, making development faster and more flexible.

3. Dynamic Types

Unlike statically typed languages where variable types must be declared, JavaScript determines data types at runtime. This makes it more flexible but also prone to certain errors.

4.Multiparadigm

JavaScript supports various programming styles including;

- procedural programming - step by step instructions.

- Object Oriented Programming - using objects and classes.

- Functional Programming - Treating functions as first class citizens.

4. Event Driven

JavaScript allows developers to define actions that occur in response to events, such as a user clicking a button or submitting a form.

5. Prototype Based

JavaScript does not use traditional class-based inheritance (like Java or C++). Instead, it follows prototype-based inheritance, where objects inherit properties from other objects.

6. Asychronous and Non-Blocking

JavaScript can handle multiple operations at once using asynchronous programming, primarily with callbacks, promises, and async/await. This makes it suitable for real-time applications like chat apps and live notifications.

## Where JavaScript is Used

1. Web development - to create interactive elements, forms, animations and apis.

2. Mobile App Development - Platforms such as React Native allow creation of cross platform apps. (android and ios).

3. Backend Development - With platforms such as Node.js, JavaScript can power servers and Databases.

4. Maching Learning and AI - frameworks such as TensorFlow.js allows AI models to run on browser.

5. Game Development -web based games.
