# JavaScript Releases

Bredan Eich created the very first version of JavaScript in 1995, in only 10 days. It was called `Mocha`. It already had most features that modern JS has today.

He was hired by the NetScape Navigator, which by that time was the dominant browser.

`ECMAScript` - standards, `JavaScript` - Language.

`ES6 OR ECMAScript2015`

## JavaScript has Backward Compatibility.

If you take some JavaScript code written in 1997, and put it in a modern browser with a modern JS engine, it will still work the same.

JS Engine today is able to understand JS code written ago, this is due to the principle, 'DONT BREAK THE WEB'.

- Nothing is removed from the language, only new releases.

### We will focus on modern JS in this course.
