# High Level Overview of JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level,prototype based, objected oriented, interpreted (Just In Time compiled), dynamic, single threaded, garbage collected and multi-paradign programming langauge with first class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

- High Level - automatic management of resources.

- Garbage collection - automatically cleans the memory.

- Multiparadigm - procedural, OOP and functional programming code structure.

## JavaScript Engine and Run-Time

`JS engine` - its the computer program that executes theJS code.

For example for Google Chrome we have `Google V8`.

- Node.js

Other browsers have their own enginees.

Compilation - converts code to machine code and written in a binary file exeuted by the computer.
Interpretation - Interprators runs through source code and executes it line by line. Interpretation is slow.

The mix of both compilation and interpretation is called `Just In Time` (JIT) compilation.

We have various web APIs such as the:

- Timers
- DOM
- Fetch API
- ...
